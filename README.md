# Genesis Spark
Genesis Spark is a turn based strategy epic RPG focused on character legacy.

The characters in the game that the player can control are named Greyfolk. They are not of any specific race, and might not even be human, it is ultimately up to the player to determine what they are.

#### As of version Cel.0.1, Genesis Spark is able to:
* Generate a planet with a unique name, name for residence, and chronlogical details.
* Generate a series of 18 Greyfolk over the course of 1-2 in game years that have unique names.
* Calculate the date on the current planet and the age of all Greyfolk.

#### Ultimately, Genesis Spark should be able to:
* Let the player command their Greyfolk to do various things, such as: exploring, fighting and building.
* Allow Greyfolk to have meaningful conversations between themselves. Procedurally generated based off of likes, dislikes and current/past events.
* Create history and legacies among the Greyfolk.
* Play through a series of "phases" starting with Genesis and ending with Ragnarok. Each phase will have a goal, and some might even have slightly different game mechanics.
